**Part 1: Unveiling Insights from Sales Data with SQL SELECT Queries**

Welcome to my collection of SQL files, scripts, and database management resources! To kick things off, we willl dive into the heart of data retrieval: the **SELECT query**. In this section, I will be using a sales dataset to illustrate the power and versatility of SQL commands listed below.

Imagine you are a data analyst tasked with extracting meaningful insights from a bustling online store's transaction records. Our journey begins with the init_selectqueries file, a treasure trove of examples that demonstrate how to precisely pull information from sales database.

* **SELECT:** Specifies columns to retrieve (e.g., `SELECT column1, column2...` or `SELECT *` for all).
* **FROM:** Indicates the source table(s).
* **WHERE:** Filters rows based on conditions.
* **GROUP BY:** Groups rows with matching column values. It is often used with aggregate functions such as **SUM()**, **AVG()** among others.
* **HAVING:** Filters groups created by `GROUP BY`.
* **ORDER BY:** Sorts the result set either in **ASCENDING**  or **DESCENDING** order.
* **LIMIT:** Restricts the number of returned rows.
* **OFFSET:** Skips a specified number of rows.

Understanding these clauses allows for precise data retrieval and manipulation.
